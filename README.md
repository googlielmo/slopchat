# slopchat

An exercise in socket programming in the Java programming language: Implementing a no-frills, telnet-compatible
online chat system!

This project includes a basic implementation of the SLOP protocol in Java.

## The SLOP protocol

SLOP stands for Simple Line Oriented Protocol.

A slopchat server listens to multiple connections on a given TCP port.

A slopchat client connects to a server and can exchange SLOP messages with other clients.

Each chat message is represented as a single line string, i.e. a string of variable length terminated
by a LF character.

When a client sends a message to a server, the server sends a copy of the message to all the other
connected clients.

A copy of the message is never sent back to the sender client.

No attempt is made to re-send a failed communication, and no history is kept on the server:
Messages sent before a client has connected cannot be received by the client.
Likewise, messages sent after a client has disconnected are not available for a future reconnection.

A received message has no sender information. This is left to higher-level protocols
(or human interaction) to implement.

## How to use slopchat to chat with your LAN friends

Let's see how to start a server and a client on one or more machines in your Local Area Network.

### Starting a server

Make sure you have Java (v. >= 1.8) and Maven installed on your development machine.

On Linux/Unix/Mac please use the provided `startServer.sh` script.

```shell script
> cd slopchat
> ./startServer.sh 10000
```
The command above will compile the code and start a server on port 10000.
Remember to open your firewall and give the JVM process the permission to receive incoming connections to the port.

On any platform  (e.g., Windows) you can compile and run the code manually with the following commands.

To compile the code:
```shell script
> mvn clean package
```

To start the server:
```shell script
> java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=./src/main/resources/logging.properties -cp ./target/slopchat-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar io.github.googlielmo.slopchat.app.server.SlopchatServer 10000
```

You can edit the sample `logging.properties` file in the project under `src/main/resources/logging.properties` or
provide your own.

### Starting a client

Did you know SLOP is telnet-compatible? You can use the `telnet` command to chat.

```shell script
> telnet localhost 10000
```

Fancy trying the original slopchat client? On Linux/Unix/Mac please use the provided `startClient.sh` script.

```shell script
> cd slopchat
> ./startClient.sh localhost 10000
```
The command above will compile the code and start a client for the service on localhost port 10000.

On any platform (e.g., Windows) you can start the client manually with the following command. 

```shell script
> java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=./src/main/resources/logging.properties -cp ./target/slopchat-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar io.github.googlielmo.slopchat.app.client.Slopchat localhost 10000
```
## Using the client and/or the server from your own code

You can embed a slopchat server or client in your own project.

### Instantiating a server

This is all you need to start serving slopchat clients:

```java
new ChatServer(port).serve();
```

The `serve()` method is not meant to return, therefore you may want to execute it in a separate thread.

This implementation uses a thread-per-client approach, where a new dedicated thread is created
to handle each connection for receiving and dispatching incoming messages.

#### Changing the server behaviour

Do you need a customized server? Perhaps you want to change or otherwise process incoming messages e.g., to implement a
higher-level protocol or to add new functionalities, such as chatrooms, private messages, nicknames, etc.
In order to do so you just need to implement the `MessageProcessor` interface, which allows you to control
all inbound and outbound messages:

```java
    /**
     * Process an incoming message.
     * This method is invoked once per incoming message, before the message dispatching.
     * @param message the original wire message
     * @param sender the sender ClientHandler
     * @return An optional string: the (possibly new) message to dispatch if present, or empty to ignore the message
     */
    Optional<String> processIncomingMessage(String message, ClientHandler sender);

    /**
     * Process an outgoing message.
     * This method is called during the message dispatching, once for each connected client as recipient.
     * @param message the message to send, already processed by {@link #processIncomingMessage(String, ClientHandler)}.
     * @param sender the sender ClientHandler
     * @param recipient the recipient ClientHandler
     * @return An optional string: the (possibly new) message to send if present, or empty to suppress the sending
     */
    Optional<String> processSend(String message, ClientHandler sender, ClientHandler recipient);
```

You can pre-process each incoming message with the `processIncomingMessage` method.
It has to return an `Optional<String>` that â€“ if present â€“ represents the message to dispatch to other clients.
If for any reason the incoming message must be discarded (not dispatched), just return an `Optional.empty()`.

Likewise, each outgoing message can be processed by implementing the `processSend` method, which is called once for
each connected client as a recipient.
An `Optional<String>` is returned that â€“ if present â€“ represents the message to send to the recipient. If `empty` the
sending is cancelled.

The default implementation for these methods is what you would expect.
The `processIncomingMessage` method just returns the incoming message (no pre-processing).
The `processSend` method checks that the sender and the recipient are different instances, and if so it returns the
message unchanged. If sender and recipient are one and the same, an empty value is returned and the sending is
cancelled.

### Implementing a client

To turn your app into a slopchat client you instantiate a `ChatClient`:

```java
    ChatClient client = new ChatClient(serverName, port, eventHandler);
    client.connect();
```

In the snippet above `eventHandler` is your own implementation of the `ChatEventHandler` interface:

```
    /**
     * Server connection event
     */
    void onConnect();

    /**
     * Incoming message event
     * @param message the message
     */
    void onMessage(String message);

    /**
     * Server disconnection event
     */
    void onDisconnect();
```

When your client receives a message the `onMessage` method is invoked on your handler to pass it the incoming message.
The `onConnect` and `onDisconnect` methods notify your handler about connection and disconnection events, respectively.

After a successful connection with the server, your app can send a message by invoking the `sendMessage` method:

```java
    client.sendMessage(message);
```

Putting it all together, our console-based client looks like the following, error handling and all.

```java
    @Override
    public void onConnect() {
        System.out.println("Connected! ^C to quit");
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessage(String message) {
        // print incoming message to console
        System.out.println(message);
    }

    @Override
    public void onDisconnect() {
        System.out.println("Disconnected from server, bye");
        System.exit(0);
    }

    /**
     * Connect to server and handle console input
     * @throws IOException
     */
    private void execute() throws IOException {
        BufferedReader consoleReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        ChatClient client = new ChatClient(serverName, port, this);
        try {
            client.connect();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot connect to server, bye");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        while (true) {
            // read message from console
            String message = consoleReader.readLine();
            // send it to server
            client.sendMessage(message);
        }
    }
```

That's it. Have fun with slopchat!
